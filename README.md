# Fatal Police Shooting in the US

Since Jan. 1, 2015, The Washington Post has been compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the US by a police officer in the line of duty. The database includes the race, age and gender of the deceased, whether the person was armed, and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis. 

The notebook provides a preliminary data analysis of the Post data and four additional US census datasets including poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, and racial demographics.
